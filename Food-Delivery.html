      <p>
        Analyzed 45K+ delivery records using Python, Excel, and Tableau to uncover trends in delays, 
        weather impact, and city-wise delivery times. Identified 74% spike in festival-day delays and 
        lower ratings during sunny conditions to guide operational improvements.
      </p>

      <!-- Questions Answered -->
      <h5 style="margin-top: 30px;">Here are the questions I was interested in answering:</h5>
      <p>
        1) What is the average delivery rating?<br>
        2) What are the most common weather conditions during delays?<br>
        3) Does traffic impact delivery time?<br>
        4) What is the impact of festivals on delivery delays?<br>
        5) What are the most common times for delays?<br>
        6) How does weather affect customer ratings?<br>
        7) At what times of day are orders at their peak in each city?<br>
        8) How are delivery times and weather conditions distributed across the country?<br>
        9) Which cities experience the highest average delivery times, and during which hours?<br>
        10) How do traffic and weather jointly impact delivery efficiency and customer satisfaction?
      </p>

      <!-- Process -->
      <h5 style="margin-top: 30px;">I took the following steps to create my analysis:</h5>
      <p>
        1) <strong> Preprocessing & ETL (Python):</strong>
        Cleaned and transformed raw delivery data using pandas — handled null values, standardized columns, 
        merged date-time fields, and engineered features such as delivery delay duration, order hour, and weather impact flags.<br>

        </div>
       2) <strong> Analysis & Metrics (Advanced Excel):</strong>
        Conducted deep-dive analysis using pivot tables, GETPIVOTDATA, conditional formulas, and statistical functions (like MAX, MODE.SNGL) 
        to extract key insights on delivery time, traffic impact, weather patterns, and festival influence.<br>

        </div>
       3) <Strong>Interactive Visualization (Tableau):</Strong>
        Built a dynamic dashboard with visual filters (slicers for city, festival, weather), KPI cards, bar and line charts, 
        and geographic symbol maps — allowing stakeholders to explore delivery trends by time, location, and external conditions.

      <!-- Key Takeaways -->
      <h5 style="margin-top: 30px;">Here are my key takeaways:</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>The average delivery time was 26 minutes, with a maximum delay reaching up to 54 minutes.</li>
        <li>Fog was the most common weather condition observed during delayed deliveries.</li>
        <li>Traffic congestion was a major contributor to delivery delays, especially in metro areas during peak hours.</li>
        <li>City-wise trends revealed that delivery performance varied sharply by location and hour, with some cities peaking in orders late at night.</li>
        <li>Semi-urban regions saw the majority of orders post-12 PM, and these areas also had higher average delivery times than metropolitan cities.</li>
        <li>Bad traffic and weather conditions consistently contributed to delays, especially during evening hours in metro cities.</li>
        <li>Customer ratings dropped by over 13% during sunny conditions, highlighting a potential risk to satisfaction during adverse weather.</li>
