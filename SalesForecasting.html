      <p>
        Built a hybrid ARIMA-Random Forest model on Walmart’s sales data to forecast weekly sales. 
        Achieved high accuracy (MSE: 0.0179) and identified key patterns across stores and departments to 
        support inventory and planning decisions.

      <!-- Questions Answered -->
      <h5 style="margin-top: 30px;">Here are the questions I was interested in answering:</h5>
      <p>
        1) What was the business objective of your project?<br>
        2) How does removing outliers affect model performance?
        <br>
        3) How do different machine learning models perform in forecasting retail sales?
        <br>
        4) What is the most suitable forecasting model for a large retail dataset with mixed trends and noise?<br>
        5) How did you decide on the hybrid ARIMA-RF model?
        <br>
        6) How does Random Forest complement ARIMA in your hybrid model?<br>
        7) What features did you engineer from the date field?<br>
        8) Why is forecasting important for retail businesses like Walmart?
      </p>

      <h5>What was the business objective of your project?</h5>
      <p>
        The goal was to forecast weekly sales for Walmart stores by identifying trends, seasonality, and irregular sales patterns to improve demand planning, inventory management, and revenue forecasting.
      </p>

      

      <!-- Process -->
      <h5 style="margin-top: 30px;">I took the following steps to create my analysis:</h5>

      <ul>
        <li>Collected data from the Walmart Sales Forecasting dataset on Kaggle (sales, features, and store information).</li>
        <li>Merged datasets using <strong>Store</strong> and <strong>Date</strong> as keys.</li>
        <img src="images/merge_dataset.PNG" alt="Sales Forecasting" style="width: 55%;">
        <li>Handled missing values: filled CPI and Unemployment with median; MarkDowns with 0 for missing/negative values.</li>
        <img src="images/handling_missing_values.PNG" alt="Sales Forecasting" style="width: 55%;">
      </ul>

      <!-- Feature Engineering -->
      <h5>Feature Engineering</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Extracted <strong>year</strong>, <strong>month</strong>, and <strong>week</strong> from the Date field.</li>
        <li>Calculated <strong>total markdown</strong> by summing MarkDown1–5 and dropped individual columns.</li>
        <li>Applied <strong>one-hot encoding</strong> to Store, Dept, and Type using <code>pd.get_dummies()</code>.</li>
        <li>Removed outliers using <strong> z-score normalization </strong>and filtered out records with negative weekly sales for cleaner model input.</li>
        <li>Applied <strong>Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)</strong> to select top contributing features.</li>

          <img src="images/outlier.PNG" alt="Sales Forecasting" style="width: 20%; display: block; margin-bottom: 8px;">
          <label>Output of dataset without outliers</label>
        </div>


        
      </ul>

      <!-- Outlier Removal -->
      <h5>How does removing outliers affect model performance?</h5>
      <p>
        Removing outliers reduced variance in model predictions, prevented skewing of model weights, and improved accuracy, especially for models sensitive to large deviations like ARIMA and ANN.
      </p>

      <!-- Model Building -->
      <h5>How do different machine learning models perform in forecasting retail sales?</h5>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>ARIMA:</strong> Good at modeling linear trends and seasonality but struggled with noise.</li>
        <li><strong>Holt-Winters:</strong> Simple seasonal model but less accurate than ensemble methods.</li>
        <li><strong>Prophet:</strong> Useful for daily/weekly seasonality, easy to tune.</li>
        <li><strong>ANN:</strong> Performed decently but required more tuning and data normalization.</li>
        <li><strong>Random Forest:</strong> Captured non-linear patterns and interactions well.</li>
      </ul>
      
      

      <!-- Hybrid Model -->
      <h5>What is the most suitable forecasting model for a large retail dataset with mixed trends and noise?</h5>
      <p>
        A hybrid ARIMA-Random Forest model performed best by combining ARIMA's strength in trend/seasonality with Random Forest’s power to capture residual, non-linear behavior.
      </p>

      <h5>How did you decide on the hybrid ARIMA-RF model?</h5>
      <p>
        After analyzing ARIMA residuals and noticing patterns that ARIMA failed to capture, I trained a Random Forest on those residuals, significantly improving the overall forecast accuracy.
      </p>

      <h5>How does Random Forest complement ARIMA in your hybrid model?</h5>
      <p>
        ARIMA handled the linear and seasonal components, while Random Forest modeled the residuals, capturing non-linearities and store-specific behaviors that ARIMA missed.
      </p>

      <!-- Forecasting Importance -->
      <h5>Why is forecasting important for retail businesses like Walmart?</h5>
      <p>
        Accurate forecasts help Walmart optimize inventory, reduce stockouts and overstocks, plan promotions effectively, and align staffing and logistics with expected demand.
      </p>

      <!-- Key Takeaways -->
      <h5 style="margin-top: 30px;">Here are my key takeaways:</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>The hybrid ARIMA-RF model achieved the lowest MSE (0.0179), offering the most accurate forecasts.</li>
        <li>Data cleaning, especially handling missing values and outliers, is crucial for model stability.</li>
        <li>Economic indicators like CPI and Unemployment are strong predictors of retail sales trends.</li>
        <li>ARIMA alone is not sufficient for complex retail data due to its inability to handle non-seasonal and nonlinear patterns effectively.</li>
        <li>Ensemble models like Random Forest improve performance by reducing overfitting and capturing variable importance.</li>
        <li>Forecasting enables better resource allocation, financial planning, and operational efficiency in retail.</li>
      </ul>
